## Student Performance Metrics Evaluation
This project analyzes a dataset containing student performance metrics to understand factors affecting academic success and predict student outcomes. The dataset includes demographic information, study habits, and academic results. The goal is to build a predictive model and provide actionable insights for educators and administrators.

### Dataset
* Contains info like age, gender, study habits, previous grades, and lifestyle choices
* Target variable: final grade or pass/fail

### What I Did
* Explored the data – checked trends, correlations, and distributions
* Cleaned & prepared – handled missing values and encoded categories
* Built models – used Logistic Regression and Decision Trees to predict outcomes
* Evaluated models – looked at accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
* Insights – found which factors most affect performance

### Tools
* Python, Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
